        <h2>Who Is Alex?</h2>
        <p>
            Alex is the bubbly, confident, chaotic-good friend who walks into a room and instantly boosts the energy level. She's the girl who can talk to anyone, laugh easily, and somehow make strangers feel like long‑lost besties. A total girl boss with elite sarcasm skills, she flirts with guys she *isn’t* interested in and completely ignores the ones she *does* like (Christmas tradition, honestly).
        </p>

        <p class="tagline">✨ Festive. Fabulous. Fearlessly herself. ✨</p>

        <h2>Alex's Holiday Traits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>❄️ Spreads kindness everywhere—acts of service and baking are literally her love languages.</li>
            <li>🎁 Gives gifts that somehow always feel meaningful, even when she claims she’s “not sure what to get.”</li>
            <li>🌟 Can talk to people for hours but mysteriously struggles with conversations with new people.</li>
            <li>🎄 High expectations for people—she knows her worth and expects others to rise to her level.</li>
            <li>☕ Loves deep convos, cozy vibes, and spending real time with her people.</li>
            <li>💗 Looks like a Hallmark main character but has a girl-boss edge.</li>
            <li>👀 Gives elite eye contact and actually considers other people’s perspectives.</li>
            <li>😂 Funny, quirky, and laughs easily. Like… dangerously charming levels of funny.</li>
            <li>🤝 Would literally do anything for her friends.</li>
            <li>🧊 Handles uncomfortable situations like a pro.</li>
            <li>💕 Loves sports, being active, and is always down for fun.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Alex Is the Spirit of Christmas</h2>
        <p>
            She’s warm, she’s thoughtful, she loves people deeply, and she brings joy into every room—kind of like if 
            hot cocoa became a person but also knew how to roast you lovingly. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If Christmas cheer had a spokesperson, it would be Alex—green almond-shaped eyes sparkling, freckles catching the winter light, dark brown wavy hair in cute braids, and the kind of warm energy that could make even a stressed-out mall Santa relax.
